# Web Programming Project :  

.Net 6.0 Web Site. I tried to make exact copy of Turkish Airlines website by looking at it.  
An user can search flight and buy it by selecting a seat visually. When a flight selected, matching airplane ( that airplane is dynamic so there is number of airplane and correct one is showing up ) shows up.  
An admin can list an user, change an user's role, search a fligt, create a flight, create an airplane, see ticktes, see full and empty seats and much more.
